// task 14 - Binary and linear search
// Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving a problem or performing a task. They are essential in computer science for 
// data processing, // calculations, and other automated tasks.


// Efficiency:
`.) Time complexity tells us how fast or slow an algorithm runs as the input size grows.
O(n): Linear time complexity - the time taken grows linearly with the input size.
O(log n): Logarithmic time complexity - the time taken grows logarithmically with the input size.

Example: searching an item in a list of 1000000 numbers
.) Linear Search (O(n)):may take upto 1000000 steps
.) Binary Search (O(log n)): may take upto 20 steps (if the list is sorted)
